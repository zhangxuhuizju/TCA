This is Anton Schwaighofer's MATLAB interface to SVM light.

It requires Thorsten Joachims's svmlight software to run.

Anton used to make it available on line but his page has disappeared so we've placed it on GitHub here. This version was last edited in 2002.

It is available through a GPL license.
